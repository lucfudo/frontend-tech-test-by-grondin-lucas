# LumApps Frontend Test by GRONDIN Lucas

## Introduction
Thanks to LumApps for giving me the opportunity to make and test this "LumApps Frontend Test".
### Stack
I used SCSS and YARN for the first time.
I tried to integrate the LumApps library, but I thought it would be good to show what I could do without it,
I hope I will have the opportunity to learn more about this library from you

### Application
I have integrated all the requested features with a small modification/addition in the "HomePage", a dynamic list linked to the search.

I have encountered a small problem with the API, indeed I was given an API key `8fb61ed0d8ae4cc76943c8d2b8e2ed9c`,
however this key does not give the possibility to use the api correctly.

I may have failed to follow this guideline:
NB: In order to use this API key, you have to edit your `/etc/hosts` file, adding this line `127.0.0.1   develop.lumapps.com`.

### Mockup
I made the mockup on AdobeXD to follow it as well as possible.
([Design.xd](other/design.xd)).


## Comments
I really enjoyed doing this test, it was very well guided, the steps were clear.
I think that adding a time limit would be a good idea, in fact I had one week to do it (even if I tried to follow the limit indicated in the README - a day).

I have a beginner level on this technology, having used it only for one school project.
However, I learn quickly and well especially if I am well accompanied, being at your side will allow me I am sure to master these different technologies.
And working with me will allow you, I am sure, to have a new approach of these technologies.

Thanks again to LumApps, and we hope to get some positive feedback!
